##### Embedded Systems
Is the name given to computers that are included as an integral part of a larger system, typically hardwired in.
Embedded systems are designed with a single control purpose and have no additional functionality, this does not mean that they are free of risk or security concerns.
###### Raspberry Pi
Determining the risk profiles and addressing them is needed and important task
Securing a raspberry pi is similar to securing any other system
###### Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FGPAs)
FGPAs are electronic circuits that are programmed to perform a specific function
The logic is programmed before use using configurable logic blocks (CLBs)
FGPAs are designed to bed reprogrammed to the desired functionality

###### Arduino
A single board microcontroller
Raspberry Pi is configured as a computer
Arduino is designed as a controller
Coding works when power is applied
Expansion of Arduino is done via a series of boards called shields that can add functionality in networking
##### SCADA and ICS
SCADA is a system designed to control automated systems in a cyber physical environment
SCADA have their own smart components, each an example of an embedded system.
Also known as a distributed control system (DCS) or an industrial control system (ICS) depending on the industry and configuration
Where computers control a physical process directly, a SCADA system likely is involved
Most SCADA systems involve multiple components networked together to achieve a set of functional objectives.
These systems frequently include a human machines interface (HMI), where an operator can exert a form of directive control over the operation of the system under control
SCADA has historically been isolated from other systems, but the isolation is decreasing as these systems are being connected across traditional networks to improve business function
###### Facilities
SCADA systems find many uses in facilities,  from building elevators, escalators and elevators, and HVAC systems.
##### Internet of Things (IoT)
Designed to do a specific tasks
##### Specialized Systems
Designed for special purposes.
4 primary types of systems. Medical devices, vehicles, aircraft and smart meters.
###### Vehicle Systems
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is designed to allow multiple microcontrollers to communicate with each other without a central host computer.
##### Voice over IP (VoIP)
VoIP requires protections from standard traffic-based attacks such as denial of service, but also need protections from spoofing
Additional risks include outsiders using your VoIP to connect to international telephony services and offering free phone calls or using your phone service to robocall people
##### HVAC
Examples of systems that are managed by embedded systems.
Having a smart building and adding internet based central control mechanisms increases the risk profile of outside attacks
