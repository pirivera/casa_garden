[Objective 1.1] Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques

###### Social Engineering Methods
*Social engineering* is an attack against a user, and typically involves some for of social interaction.
**The best defense against social engineering attacks is a comprehensive training and awareness program that includes social engineering**

###### Phishing
- An attacker trying to obtain sensitive information from users by masquerading as a trusted entity in an e-mail or instant message.
	The attacker tries to obtain information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and bank account details. Often done by the use of a fake website that appears legit. Mass emails warning of a compromised account is used as well with instructions to click on the attached link.
	
`Phishing is now the most common form of social engineering`
###### Smishing
*Smishing* is an attack using SMS on victim's phones. Phishing via SMS.
Works primarily in the use of urgency and intimidation.
###### Vishing
*Vishing* is phishing through voice communication to obtain information.
Vishing takes advantage of trust that people place in telephone networks.
Attackers can spoof calls from legitimate entities using VoIP technology.
The user may receive an e-mail asking to call this number or a call might come in using prerecorded message.
**The user should not provide any information but instead examine legitimate statements with a number or the Internet**

`Phishing, Smishing, Vishing attack cognitive states. Combination of psychological pressure.`

##### Spam
*Spam* is bulk unsolicited email, not generally a social engineering issue but a security concern.
It can be legitimate from a company but it can also be malicious by including attachments that contains software designed to harm your computer.
Always consider the source before clicking any links.
Spam can result in user clicking link, it should be regarded as a form of social engineering.
###### Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM)
Same as spam through instant messaging to get a user to click malicious links or content
###### Spear Phishing
*Spear phishing* is a term to refer a phishing attack that targets a specific person or group of people. 
###### Dumpster Diving
The process of going through a target's trash in hopes of finding valuable information that might be used in penetration attempts
Information can be useful in a social engineering attack
In most locations, trash is no longer considered private property after it has been discarded

An organization should have policies about discarding materials.
Sensitive information should be shredded and the organization should consider securing the trash receptacle so individuals can't forage through it
Shredding should be considered as well even at home
###### Shoulder Surfing
Shoulder surfing does not always involve direct contact; it can be over the shoulder, a camera setup, or binoculars to see a user entering sensitive information
Privacy screen filters is  good way to combat this and also a filter to block key pads being pressed
###### Pharming
Consists of misdirecting users to fake websites made to look official
Attackers target individuals, one by one, by sending out emails
Redirected to the fake website as a result such as DNS poisoning
On the fake site the user might provide personal information believing it is real
###### Tailgating
Tailgating (or *piggybacking*) is the tactic of following closely behind a person who has just used their own access card or PIN to gain physical access
Takes advantage of authorized user who is not following security procedures
The attacker may even start a conversation with the attacker before reaching the door so that the user may be more comfortable with allowing the individual in without challenging

This can be countered by training employees to use simple procedures to ensure nobody follows them to closely
A *mantrap* is excellent at countering which uses two doors and second doesn't open until first one is closed
###### Eliciting Information
Calls to and from help desk can be used to *elicit information*
Posing as an employee an attacker can get a password reset, or information about systems
Can go both ways, where the attacker is posing as the help desk tech. Then the attacker can get information on system status and other information.
###### Whaling
High-value targets are referred to as whales such as a CEO or CFO
Spear phishing is a common method used against whales, as the communication is designed to appear ordinary and nonsuspicious.
##### Prepending
The act of adding something to the beginning of an item
In social engineering prepending is the act of supplying information that another will act upon, in an attempt to legitimize the request.
Using authority, an attacker can use prepending by stating that they were sent by the target's boss or another authority figure to perform a specific acting which without prepending would be weird.
###### Identity Fraud
The use of fake credentials to achieve an end.
This can be high risk, pretending to be an official representative or government agency, even a janitor.
This works when the victim is expecting the person.
This can be done online as well, using known information about the person youre impersonating and deceiving the person you're attacking.

Defense for identity fraud is the same as most social engineering attacks: use strong policies and procedures without exceptions.
###### Invoice Scams
Fake invoice in an attempt to get a company to pay for things it has not ordered.
Most companies have strong accounting controls, the scam involves getting someone outside the accounting group to initiate the process, giving it a sense of legitimacy.
Common items used are office products like cleaning products, office supplies, and corporate services.
To add urgency, a final notice is included, threatening to report the organization.
###### Credential Harvesting
Involves the collection of credential information, such as user IDs and passwords enabling an attacker a series of access passes to systems.
Common form of credential harvesting starts with an phishing email that convinces a user to click a link and brings up a replica of a web page asking for credentials and then redirect you to a real page asking to login again there has been an error.

To prevent banks have implemented user ID and password with a second-factor to prevent subsequent use of harvested credentials.
###### Reconnaissance
Examine the systems they intend to attack, using a wide range of methods. 
Some of these are done using outside methods such as Google, public records search, etc.
This involves direct manipulation as well such as surveying a company's org charts, calling and asking for people's contact information and building a personnel directory, reading press releases to obtain information.
###### Hoax
Hoaxes can be damaging if it causes users to take some sort of action that weakens security and can spread.
Training and awareness are the best first line of defense
##### Impersonation
It can occur over the phone, in person, or online.
###### Third Party Authorization
Using obtained information about a project, bosses, deadlines, the attacker can arrive somewhere with this problem that he will be seen useful in and drops the name of someone with authority who is unreachable at the moment in order to make requests or achieve access. 
These actions can create the appearance of a third-party authorization.
###### Contractors/Outside Parties
An attacker can put on clothes of a contractors to match and show up on the job at a different time or say he is filling in for someone.
Then the attacker is free to roam unnoticed blending in.
###### Online Attacks
Impersonation can be used online
Pop-ups are an attack but less effective today
###### Defenses
Having processes to see employee IDS if not recognizing someone is a defense
That includes challenging people
If this is standard no one becomes offended, if someone takes offense it becomes suspicious
Best defense is to conduct training on a regular basis and tailored to what is being experienced
##### Watering Hole Attack
Attackers can plant malware at sites where users frequent
*Watering hole attack* involves infecting a targets website with malware
In some cases, infection was constrained to a specific geographical area
It would most likely be a zero0day attack to avoid detection
###### Typosquatting
An attack that involves capitalizing upon typographical errors
If a user mistypes a URL the user would land on the attackers page
Also known as *URL hijacking, fake URL, or brandjacking*
It can be to obtain credentials or to plant malware on the victim
###### Pretexting
The attacker uses a narrative to influence the victim into giving up information
It does not have to be true; it only needs to be believable
The main goal is to gain the target's trust and exploit it
Can occur in person, by email, over the phone, or any form of communication
##### Influence Campaigns
Use of collected information and publication to influence and alter perceptions and change people's minds on a topic
Powerful when used with social media to spread influence, this amplifies and rapidly spreads disinformation
Known as hybrid warfare and propaganda

### Principles (Reasons for Effectiveness)
##### Authority
In social situations this can lead to an environment where one party feels at risk in challenging another.
Best defense is strong set of policies that has no exceptions
##### Intimidation
Can be subtle, through perceived power, or more direct that builds expectation of superiority
##### Scarcity
Something in short supply and is valued, arriving with what is needed can bring rewards
By bringing impression of scarcity an attacker can motivate a target to make a decision quickly
##### Familiarity
People do things for people they feel connected to.
This can lead to misplaced trust
##### Trust
Shape perceptions of a target where they will apply judgments to the trust and come to false conclusions.
Not to force people to do things they would not do but to give them a pathway that leads them to feel they are doing the correct thing in the moment
#### Defenses
Begins with policies and procedures
Visitor access rules
Verifying requests before sharing
Multiple layers of approval
